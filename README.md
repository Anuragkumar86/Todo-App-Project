# To-Do App with MongoDB Integration
A dynamic To-Do App built using React, MongoDB, JSON Server, and Axios. This app allows users to manage tasks in real-time, supporting features like adding, updating, and deleting tasks. It leverages MongoDB as a backend database for storing and updating tasks efficiently.

# Features
React for building a dynamic user interface
Hooks for state management (useState, useEffect)
Axios for making HTTP requests to fetch and modify data
MongoDB for robust, scalable data storage and real-time updates
CRUD Operations: Add, delete, and update tasks seamlessly
Error Handling and Loading States for a smooth user experience

# Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing tasks data
JSON Server: A tool to create a fake REST API for development and testing
Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests

# Features
Interactive UI: Buttons to add and delete tasks dynamically
Real-time data management: Tasks are added, updated, or deleted in MongoDB
Task List: View tasks in a neatly formatted list with their descriptions
Error and Loading States: Provides feedback to users during asynchronous data fetching operations

#Future Enhancements
User authentication to manage personal tasks
Task priority and due date management
